This paper provides an introduction to the theory of states and representations of
C*-algebras. Beginning with basic definitions and examples, we explore the structure
of state spaces and illustrate the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construction. Connections
to quantum mechanics and noncommutative geometry are also discussed.
