\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
C*-algebras are a generalization of function algebras and play a crucial role in
functional analysis, quantum mechanics, and noncommutative geometry. This paper aims
to provide an accessible introduction to the concepts of states and their representations.
Only a basic level of functional analysis is required to fully grasp all the concepts
presented. We are trying to take a tensor product-free approach to keep things as
simple and accessible as possible. However, the examples in quantum field theory,
namely Fock spaces, require a basic knowledge of tensor products. The quantum field
theory section is at the end and can easily be ommitted without consequence.



\subsection{Motivation}
Discuss the motivation for studying states and their representations. Include their relevance to various mathematical and physical theories.

\subsection{Structure of the Paper}
